# British-Airways-Customer-Reviews-Dashboard

# Project Overview
This Tableau dashboard was built to analyze and visualize customer reviews for British Airways. The aim was to uncover trends and insights across several key service metrics, helping to better understand customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. By breaking down review scores across different filters and dimensions, this tool serves as a powerful aid in making data-informed decisions for enhancing the passenger experience.

# Business Questions 

The dashboard was created to address several business questions:

Are there noticeable trends in customer satisfaction throughout the year?
- Seasonal dips or spikes in reviews can point to staffing or service challenges that need attention.

Does aircraft type influence how customers rate their experience?
- Aircraft models might correlate with different levels of comfort or in-flight amenities.

Are certain routes or countries generating consistently lower ratings?
- Pinpointing these can guide improvements in specific regions or services.

Do seat type and travel purpose (business vs leisure) impact satisfaction differently?
- This helps in tailoring services or upgrades for different passenger segments.

By making these insights visible and accessible, the dashboard supports operational teams, marketing strategists, and customer service managers in making more targeted and strategic decisions.
